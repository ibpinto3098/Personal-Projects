# Personal Projects: Exploratory Data Analysis focusing on Supply Chain Functions
<div align = 'justify';'><p>Greetings! Welcome to my portfolio repository! A few introductions about myself, I am an inspiring Data Analyst / Scientist that wishes to focus on various <strong>Supply Chain Functions from Logistics, Warehousing or Inventory Management, and Sales to Consumers.</strong> 
 I have a Bachelors Degree in Industrial Engineering and a Masters Degree in Supply Chain thus the reason why I want to focus in these areas. My goal for this repository is to display my growing skills and my thought process throughout these various areas and projects</p></div>
<h2>List of Projects:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Supermarket Online Sales Analysis:</h4><p>In this project, you will be able to see how I explored the dataset to find trends, and consumer behavior. I have also dug deeper to find possible issues and problems that the supermarket is experiencing that may need further attention. </p>
