<div align = 'center';'><h1>Supermarket Sales Analysis</h1></div>
<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<p>The dataset provided was sourced from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting">Kaggle</a>. Initially, the dataset was intended to forecast the sales of next seven days, however I opted to simply do an extensive analysis of the dataset trying to find possible problems that can be extracted from the file. Below you will be able to see a summary showing all the goals of the study, the important insights I was able to obtain, and finally a more extensive discussion of my thought process going through the file.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>The goals of the study are as follows:<br></p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine the Sales Trend over the years</li>
  <li>Determine the demographics of the company's consumers</li>
  <li>Determine the most commonly used shipping mode by consumers</li>
  <li>Dig deeper into the dataset to find possible inights and problems</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The dataset provided various information regarding the sales of products such as Order Date, Shipping Date, Customer Type, Product Category, Product Name, and finally Sales volume. Firstly, we have extracted the Sales Trend over the years to see the supermarket's overall behavior. On top of this, we have also extracted their top selling products.  We can see the image below:
