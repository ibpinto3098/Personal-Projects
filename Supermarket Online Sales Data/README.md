<div align = 'center';'><h1>Supermarket Sales Analysis</h1></div>
<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<div align='justify';'><p>The dataset provided was sourced from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting">Kaggle</a>. Initially, the dataset was intended to forecast the sales of next seven days, however I opted to simply do an extensive analysis of the dataset trying to find possible problems that can be extracted from the file. Below you will be able to see a discussion showing all the goals of the study and the important insights I was able to obtain, and finally a more extensive discussion of my thought process going through the file.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>The goals of the study are as follows:<br></p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine the Sales Trend over the years</li>
  <li>Determine the demographics of the company's consumers</li>
  <li>Determine the most commonly used shipping mode by consumers</li>
  <li>Dig deeper into the dataset to find possible inights and problems</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this dataset, I was able to determine the Sales Trend over time and has shown that it has been increasing over time. There are three categories namely, Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture, wherein the Technology category is the supermarket's best selling type of product. Over the years, the Corporate sector has shown an increasing buying trend for the supermarket which the supermarket should capitalize as these sector specifically has the higher buying power compared to the 2 other categories, Consumer, and Home Office customer types. In terms of locations, a big part of the sales volume are mainly in the United States, specifically California, New York, and Texas. The company may move further to try and penetrate other locations.  One of the areas for analysis is the different Shipping Modes the supermarket offers namely, Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, and Same day delivery.  Through the study, I was able to compare these four different types' lead times and was able to find one issue that the supermarket may face.  There are Same day deliveries that were not able to deliver during the day. Amongst those order, I delved deeper to find what may cause this and I was able to see that those that were not delivered the same day were Furnitures.  I compared the average quantity ordered that was successfuly ordered the same day, and those that were late and saw a large difference in volume. The supermarket may look deeper into this situation to find solutions in order to prevent this.</p>

<h3>Extensive Discussion</h3>
<h4>Sales Analysis</h4>
<p>The dataset provided various information regarding the sales of products such as Order Date, Shipping Date, Customer Type, Product Category, Product Name, and finally Sales volume. Firstly, we have extracted the Sales Trend over the years to see the supermarket's overall behavior. On top of this, we have also created a graph that shows the trend per category. There are three different product categories: <strong>Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies</strong>.  The findings was that the trend is increasing overtime across the three different categories wherein the Technology Category has garnered the highest amount of sales, whilst Furnitures has the lowest amount. Overall, the supermarket has sold over 2,260,000 products across the years and counting.

<p>We are also able to extract the top 10 products the supermarket sold and were able to determine that the product <em>"Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier"</em> has the top spot. The product was sold for a total of 61,599 units which is 2.7% of the total products sold. The rest of the products can be seen below</p>

<p>Afterwards, I wanted to see if are there any particular product pairings that may be happening and see if this happens a significant amount of time.  A bar graph below would show the top 10 pairings that we were able to extract from the dataset. The top pairing was <em>(Acco Pressboard Covers with Storage Hooks,  14 7/8" x 11")</em> with 24 occurences out of 4,922 receipts.  This may indicate that there is no clear buying behaviour throughout the supermarket.</p>

<h4>Consumer Analysis</h4>
<p>Afterwards I wanted to look into the demographics of the company consumers and also their buying patterns. First of all, there are three different types of Customer Type namely, Consumer, Home Office, and Corporate. In order to analyze easier, we could get insights from the graphs below:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/ibpinto3098/Personal-Projects/assets/144035560/b73bda85-be08-482c-899b-2ee3c323da62"/>
<p>From the graphs we are able to see that the general consumer has the highest amount of sales across the three different customer type.  However, if we look carefully both Consumer, and Home Office does not have a clear trend and just averaging throughout.  The <strong>Corporate type on the other hand has been increasing over the years which may indiciate a good sign especially that Corporate has a higher buying power compared to both Consumer and Home Office.</strong></p>
<p>To go even deeper, we want to see which categories each customer type buys.  This can easily be done through using a pie chart.
</p>

<p>Majority across the different customer types, each product category is disitrbuted equally, however for the Home Office Customer type, Technology is slightly higher compared to the different types whereas it has almost 43% of bought products from the category as compared to the other two customer types having only around 35%.</p>
<p>Next we want to see where are our customers are located. Since majority are in the United States, we want to see which states are have the highest amount of sales. From the graph below, California has the highest amount of customers, followed by New York, and then Texas. We also want to see what buyers usually use as shipping mode / delivery options namely, <em>Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, or Same Day</em>. Across all of the three different consumer type, Standard Class is their most preferred type, this may be because it is the cheapest option.</p>

<h4>Lead Time Analysis</h4>
<p>Now that we know the different delivery options, I wanted to dig deeper around the lead time and hopefully find possible issues.  Now, the provided dataset does not show any lead time, however it has provided Ship Date, and Order Date which the difference we can assume as the lead time. I have analyzed the different lead tiems in various ways. Firstly, I wanted to see if there is any difference if the Order Date Day (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.) from each other. This is followed by the comparison depending on the shipping mode, and lastly again compared by product category type. To do this much simpler, I have made a box plot which can showcase all of the information needed.</p>

<p>From this, we can see that there are no significant difference from Order Date Day, and also if we compare it to each product category type. However, there are differences if we compare it to each Shipping Mode, which makes sense since if you are paying for a premium for faster delivery, the signifance should be apparent. One thing that I have noticed from the middle graph is that Same day deliveries have outliers meaning they were <strong>unable to deliver</strong>within the same day.  I want to explore in these a bit more and see if there are any significant differences from those that have successfuly deliver it the same day, and those that were not able to. I have broken down the dataset a bit more to see the intricacies within. A bar graph was made to see comparisons below.</p>
<img src="https://github.com/ibpinto3098/Personal-Projects/assets/144035560/60e66a53-92f0-4aa3-ad03-b68fd118f4d4"/>
<p>First, I have tried comparing the average sales of the two different lead times (image on the left), and see that those that were successfully delivered the same day have a higher average volume than those who did not.  I have dug even deeper and broken it down into a per category level and was able to see the furnitures volume have more average volume of those that were not successfully delivered the same day as compared to those who did. This may be a possible cause mainly because furnitures are generally bigger as compared to other products from the lists and may be harder to deliver. This may be a problem for the supermarket and may opt to investigate this further by finding solutions for this issue.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Through this analysis, we were able to determine the trend, customer demographics, and even was able to find a possible issue that the supermarket may be experience. Now that the Corporate customer segment is now increase, the company may find ways to maximize this and potential increase their hold to them. We were also able to find that lead time may be an issue especially on their same day delivery and may act upon further by the company.</p>
