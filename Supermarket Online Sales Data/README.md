<div align = 'center';'><h1>Supermarket Sales Analysis</h1></div>
<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<div align='justify';'><p>The dataset provided was sourced from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting">Kaggle</a>. Initially, the dataset was intended to forecast the sales of next seven days, however I opted to simply do an extensive analysis of the dataset trying to find possible problems that can be extracted from the file. Below you will be able to see a discussion showing all the goals of the study and the important insights I was able to obtain, and finally a more extensive discussion of my thought process going through the file.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>The goals of the study are as follows:<br></p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine the Sales Trend over the years</li>
  <li>Determine the demographics of the company's consumers</li>
  <li>Determine the most commonly used shipping mode by consumers</li>
  <li>Dig deeper into the dataset to find possible inights and problems</li>
</ol>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The dataset provided various information regarding the sales of products such as Order Date, Shipping Date, Customer Type, Product Category, Product Name, and finally Sales volume. Firstly, we have extracted the Sales Trend over the years to see the supermarket's overall behavior. On top of this, we have also created a graph that shows the trend per category. There are three different product categories: <strong>Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies</strong>.  The findings was that the trend is increasing overtime across the three different categories wherein the Technology Category has garnered the highest amount of sales, whilst Furnitures has the lowest amount. Overall, the supermarket has sold over 2,260,000 products across the years and counting.

<p>We are also able to extract the top 10 products the supermarket sold and were able to determine that the product <em>"Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier"</em> has the top spot. The product was sold for a total of 61,599 units which is 2.7% of the total products sold. The rest of the products can be seen below</p>

<p>Afterwards, I want to see if are there any particular product pairings that may be happening </p>
