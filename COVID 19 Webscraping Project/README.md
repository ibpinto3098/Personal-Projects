<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<div align='justify';'><p>The dataset provided was sourced from various Wikipedia websites. This project is slightly different from the rest as I wanted to work on a new sets of Python Tools like webscraping to gather my own data. I will also explain in detail the processes, and challenges I faced throughout my webscraping project and how I handled it. I did webscraping to extract two types of data, firstly a statistics on Covid 19 in different countries, and secondly each country's Human Development Index (HDI) from the United Nations which shows whether a categorizes country's development. </p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>The goals of this project are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create my own dataset from webscraping Wikipedia websites on Covid19 statistics, and HDI per country</li>
  <li>Clean my dataset to analyze and get insights</li>
  <li>Find relationships between the development of the country and its affect on Covid19 Cases and deaths</li>
</ol>
